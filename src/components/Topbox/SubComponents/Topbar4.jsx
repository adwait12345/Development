                  <p>SafeZen is the worldâ€™s first revolutionary truly decentralized insurance platform with two major peer-to-peer insurance models- a zero-premium insurance model backed by community participants, and a pay-as-you-go insurance model backed by underwriters and governed by the SafeZen community members, with the risk-based coverage pools for web3 and traditional insurances.</p>

                  <summary>Why Safezen ?</summary>
                  <p>
                    1. SafeZen is leading the revolution in the insurance industry by introducing the world's first innovative insurance products:

                    a. Pay-as-you-go insurance model: Only pay when you need the insurance.
                    b. Zero-premium insurance model: Interact with your favorite defi project via SafeZen and get covered with risk-based pools in case of an unfortunate unseen event, and that too paying zero-premium.

                    2. Most of the decentralized insurance platforms have speculative tokens, which can be used to stake and underwrite the insurance, and with speculation comes the greater risk of the underwriters losing their whole staked amount during the big claim payouts.

                    3. Risk-based coverage pools: None of the decentralized insurance platforms have risk-based coverage pools, that can offer better protection to the underwriters, in conjunction with the non-speculative algorithmic-based token.

                    4. Most decentralized insurance platforms are not truly decentralized, and their governance and claims are governed by the advisors of the platform.
